# GenAI-Chatbot
Generative AI Chatbot using an Internal Data Source. In this example, the source is a PDF review article from the "International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342625564_CANCER_CAUSES_AND_TREATMENTS)." The goal was to build a Generative AI Chatbot on a proprietary source not seen by ChatGPT and to generate new results from user queries (prompt engineering, embeddings, and vector storing). The libraries used were Streamlit (https://streamlit.io/), PyPDF2 (https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/), and LangChain (https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/). The IDE used was PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). OPENAI_API_KEY (https://platform.openai.com/)

The GenAI Design PDF details the architectural framework and procedural steps undertaken during the development process. GenAI generated novel solutions and outcomes based on specific, detailed queries and prompt engineering initiated by users.
